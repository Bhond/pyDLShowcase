# Introduction

This project aims at improving my skills in Deep Learning and learning
how to use Pythorch's framwork.

# Subprojects
## MNIST

The deep learning's *"Hello world"* project. I used it as a way to start 
using Pythorch.
It uses the FashionMNIST's dataset, and it has been almost completely been
implemented along the Pytorch's tutorial.

## YOLO
This one will be an introduction to computer vision. The goal is to learn
to predict to recognize features on a camera feed. In coming...
